#### Introduction

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

---

#### Updates: 

The game can now loop through and check if the letter you have entered is in the randomly selected word or not. In the next update a function will be added to keep track of how many guesses have been taken by the user. 

#### Lessons learned

During this project the author has had to apply their learning from a number of different areas, including programming in Python, version control in git/github and the use of a CLI.

#### Installation Instructions

Once you have downloaded the source file the program can be called from Python. 

#### Usage Instructions

In order to begin the program, you will need to call the 'game.ask_for_input()'.
At this point you can decide how many lives you need by calling it as an argument. (The default value is 5 lives if the program is ran without an argument).
