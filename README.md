#### 1 - Introduction

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

#### 2- Lessons learned

During this project the author has had to apply their learning from a number of different areas, including programming in Python, version control in git/github and the use of a CLI. 

It has tested my ability to define classes with a number of methods, create working loops and purposeful use of if/else statements. At various points during the project it was clear that there were sections where I had repeated myself, or had coded the game in such a way that it was difficult to follow. 

The game started off rather clunkily with a range of if/elif/else statements before becoming the 'final'* product that you can see today. 

I'm sure it's not perfect, but for someone whose current day job is teaching 9 and 10 year olds, I don't think it's too shabby. 

*_final is italicised, because who knows, one day I may learn new skills, and I might come back and improve it even more._

#### 3- Installation Instructions

Once you have downloaded the source file the program can be called from Python within your computers terminal. Ensure that you have Python installed. 

For Linux/Mac OS users you will need to call 'Python milestone_5.py' in order to play the game. 

Windows users - You will be able to access the game in Powershell or the Command Line. 

#### 4- Usage Instructions

~~In order to begin the program, you will need to call the 'game.ask_for_input()'.~~
Good news! The game now runs automatically when it is opened! 
It can also loop itself as required, but be warned, when you run out of lives it's game over! 

#### 5- File Structure

The file structure is to be updated, for those curious minds out there, I have included the previous versions of the game so you can see the journey.
